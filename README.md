# Amazon SageMaker Deployment Project - Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree

This porject has been desgined for constructing a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the setiment of a movie review. A Pytorch model has been created and deployed using Amazon's SageMaker service.

The model has been further used for constructing a simple web app. Interaction with the deploy model has been achieved through open endpoint Amazon Lambda function. 
In this project, I have constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I have created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I have deployed my model and have constructed a simple web app which interacts with the deployed model.
