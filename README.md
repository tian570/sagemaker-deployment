# Amazon SageMaker Deployment Project - Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree

This porject was for Constructing a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the setiment of a movie review. A Pytorch model was created and deployed using Amazon's SageMaker service.

The model was further used for constructing a simple web app. Interaction with the deploy model was achieved through open endpoint Amazon Lambda function. 
n this project you will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. You will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, you will deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
